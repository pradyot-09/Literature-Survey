## Background

Organizations have been successfully harnessing the power of social media to engange with customer, but they still face challenges when it comes to using Enterprise Social Networking (ESN) internally. It has been reported by many organizations that using ESN has led to some degree of business benefits [1]. Synchronizing work hours, informal communication through formal channels, balanced coordination and constant collaboration has been identified as four important practices for improving communication in agile GSD. As a result, organizations use ESNs for communication between co-workers within the same organization. Virtual teams in Global Software Development(GSD) rely on ESN rools such as Slack, Yammer, Sharepoint, Chatter etc. These tools contribute in making the communication more asynchronous and support distributed agile development. However, organization face several challenges in making effective use of these tools and balance the communication with other types of communication such as face-to-face meetings, calls and emails. 

It is important to identify and understand the challenges, approaches and solutions for effective use of ESN for communication and coordination in distributed software engineering teams .In the past decade, number of research papers have been published in multiple conferences  reporting ﬁndings based on data mined from GitHub. As the Global Software Engineering (GSE) community continues to deepen its understanding of using ESN in GDSE, I believe it is worthwhile to reflect and summarise on the findings reported in literature on the effective use of ESN in software development.
