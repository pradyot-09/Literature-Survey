## *Title* : Towards Effective Use of Enterprise Social Networking Tools in Globally Distributed Software Engineering

## Background and Problem Statement

Organizations have been successfully harnessing the power of social media to engange with customer, but they still face challenges when it comes to using Enterprise Social Networking (ESN) internally. It has been reported by many organizations that using ESN has led to some degree of business benefits [1]. Synchronizing work hours, informal communication through formal channels, balanced coordination and constant collaboration has been identified as four important practices for improving communication in agile GSD. As a result, organizations use ESNs for communication between co-workers within the same organization. Virtual teams in Global Software Development(GSD) rely on ESN rools such as Slack, Yammer, Mattermost, Sharepoint, Chatter etc. These tools contribute in making the communication more asynchronous and support distributed agile development. However, organization face several challenges in making effective use of these tools and balance the communication with other types of communication such as face-to-face meetings, calls and emails. In 2017, Sven et al. [3] presented a case study highlighting challenges of ESN and reported several interventions to positively influence the acceptance of ESN tools.There are quite a few studies that report effective implementation of ESN tools [].

It is important to identify and understand the challenges, approaches and solutions for effective use of ESN for communication and coordination in distributed software engineering teams .In the past decade, number of research papers have been published in multiple conferences(ICGSE,ACM,JCMC etc.) reporting ﬁndings based on research and industrial experience. As the Global Software Engineering (GSE) community continues to deepen its understanding in use of ESN for GDSE, I believe it is worthwhile to reflect and summarise on the findings reported in literature on the effective use of ESN in software development.

*Objective* : The study aims to discuss the challenges faced by GDSE teams in industry and then present best-practices reported in literature to solve these challenges and enable effective use of ESN in GDSE. Also, possibly presents a vision for possible future work on challenges that remain unaddressed.

## Research Questions

RQ1: What are the challenges of using ESN tools in GDSE teams reported in literature?

RQ2: What are the best-practices for using ESN tools in GDSE teams to solve these challenges?

## Brief Research Methodology

*Selection of primary studies* : Defining search queries and executing on selected digital libraries such as ACM, IEEE Xplore, SpringerLink, Google Scholar, Science Direct etc. The main inclusion criteria would be that the research effort should focus on addressing a challenge or practice for using ESN tools. 

After going through primary studies, map the challenges found in the primary studies with appropriate best-practices of using ESN tools.
