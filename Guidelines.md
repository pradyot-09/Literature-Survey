### Reasons for performing literature survey :

- To summarise the existing evidence concerning a treatment or technology e.g. to summarise the empirical evidence of the benefits and limitations of a specific agile method. 
- To identify any gaps in current research in order to suggest areas for further investigation. 
- To provide a framework/background in order to appropriately position new research activities. 
 


**systematic review must be in accordance with a predefined search strategy.**


### Features of Systematic review 
Some of the features that differentiate a systematic review from a conventional expert literature review are: 

- Systematic reviews start by defining a review protocol that specifies the research question being addressed and the methods that will be used to perform the review.
- Systematic reviews are based on a defined search strategy that aims to detect as much of the relevant literature as possible. 
- Systematic reviews document their search strategy so that readers can assess their rigour and the completeness and repeatability of the process (bearing in mind that searches of digital libraries are almost impossible to replicate). 
- Systematic reviews require explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria to assess each potential primary study. 
- Systematic reviews specify the information to be obtained from each primary study including quality criteria by which to evaluate each primary study. 
- A systematic review is a prerequisite for quantitative meta-analysis. 

## Stages of Systematic reviews

This document summarises the stages in a systematic review into three main phases: Planning the Review, Conducting the Review, Reporting the Review. 
 
The stages associated with planning the review are: 
- Identification of the need for a review (See Section 5.1). 
- Commissioning a review (See Section 5.2). 
- Specifying the research question(s) (See Section 5.3). 
- Developing a review protocol (See Section 5.4). 
- Evaluating the review protocol (See Section 5.5). 
 
The stages associated with conducting the review are:
- Identification of research (See Section 6.1). 
- Selection of primary studies (See Section 6.2). 
- Study quality assessment (See Section 6.3). 
- Data extraction and monitoring (See Section 6.4). 
- Data synthesis (See Section 6.5). 
 
The stages associated with reporting the review are: - Specifying dissemination mechanisms (See Section 7.1).
- Formatting the main report (See Section 7.2).
- Evaluating the report (See Section 7.3). 

### Planning

The most important pre-review activities are: 
- defining research questions that systematic review will address.
- producing a review protocol (i.e plan) defining the basic review pocedures.

#### The Research Questions

Specifying the research questions is the most important part of any systematic review. The review questions drive the entire systematic review methodology: 
- The search process must identify primary studies that address the research questions.
- The data extraction process must extract the data items needed to answer the questions.
- The data analysis process must synthesise the data in such a way that the questions can be answered.

### Developing a Review Protocol
The components of a protocol include all the elements of the review plus some additional planning information: 

 - Background. The rationale for the survey. 
 - The research questions that the review is intended to answer. 
 - The strategy that will be used to search for primary studies including search terms and resources to be searched. Resources include digital libraries, specific journals, and conference proceedings. An initial mapping study can help determine an appropriate strategy. 
 - Study selection criteria. Study selection criteria are used to determine which studies are included in, or excluded from, a systematic review. It is usually helpful to pilot the selection criteria on a subset of primary studies.  
 - Study selection procedures. The protocol should describe how the selection criteria will be applied e.g. how many assessors will evaluate each prospective primary study, and how disagreements among assessors will be resolved. 
 - Study quality assessment checklists and procedures. The researchers should develop quality checklists to assess the individual studies. The purpose of the quality assessment will guide the development of checklists. 
 - Data extraction strategy. This defines how the information required from each primary study will be obtained. If the data require manipulation or assumptions and inferences to be made, the protocol should specify an appropriate validation process. 
 - Synthesis of the extracted data. This defines the synthesis strategy. This should clarify whether or not a formal meta-analysis is intended and if so what techniques will be used. 
 - Dissemination strategy (if not already included in a commissioning document). 
 - Project timetable. This should define the review schedule. 
 

 #### Good research questions

 (i) “What is the state of art of the use of analytics in requirements engineering?”
(ii) “What are the main sources of data to be used in
different types of analytics in requirements engineering?”
