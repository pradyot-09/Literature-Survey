# Research Proposal

1) Title : **A Survey of contributions to Github by the MSR Community**

2) Background : Since the advent of github, the MSR community has been mining open source repositories from Github to learn from past experiences. In the past decade there have been number of research papers have been published in MSR conference reporting ﬁndings based on data mined from GitHub. As the community continues to deepen in its understanding of software engineering thanks to the analysis performed on this platform, I believe it is worthwhile to reﬂect how research papers have exploited github for 


addressed the task of mining GitHub repositories over the last years.

3) Research questions :

4) Bibliography: all the papers contributing to github presented in MSR conference since 2010
